A Python implementation for visualizing clonal evolution dynamics using "fish plots" (also known as Muller plots).

This package provides tools to create visualizations showing the temporal changes in the frequencies of clones within a population, often used in cancer genomics and evolutionary biology.

This package is a translation of the R package [`fishplot`](https://github.com/chrisamiller/fishplot) by Chris Miller et al.

*--(TODO: Replace with an actual example plot generated by fishplotpy)--*

## Features

*   Calculates plot layout based on clonal fractions and parent-child relationships.
*   Supports multiple shapes for drawing clones:
    *   `polygon` (with adjustable starting ramp)
    *   `spline` (smooth curves, recommended)
    *   `bezier` (Note: Visual output may differ from the R version's `Hmisc::bezier`)
*   Customizable appearance: colors, background (solid/gradient), borders.
*   Optional vertical lines and timepoint labels.
*   Clone annotations (e.g., for mutations) with customizable position, angle, color, size.
*   Legend generation.
*   Option to add spacing between independent founder clones.

## Installation

```bash
# Option 1: Install from source after cloning
git clone https://github.com/sayitobar/fishplotpy.git
cd fishplotpy
pip install .

# Option 2: Install directly from GitHub
pip install git+https://github.com/sayitobar/fishplotpy.git

# Option 3: (If you upload to PyPI later)
# pip install fishplotpy
